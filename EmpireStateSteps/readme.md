Create a random walk to demonstrate walking up the empire state building using a dice.
- if dice <= 2, walk down 1 step
- if dice <= 5, walk up 1 step
- else, step up a random number of steps using the dice again.
- you also have a 1% chance to fall down to the 0th step.

Print out the histogram and print the chance to reach the 60th step after 100 rolls.
